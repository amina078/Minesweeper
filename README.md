Minesweeper User Manual

Welcome to Minesweeper! This classic puzzle game challenges your logic and deduction skills as you uncover hidden mines without triggering them. In your Python terminal version of Minesweeper, unrevealed cells are marked with "#," and mines are marked as "X." To get started, follow these simple instructions:

Setting Up the Game

Launch the Game: Open your Python terminal and run the Minesweeper program.

Select Board Size: You'll be prompted to choose the board size. Enter your desired dimensions and the equal size rows and columns appear.

Specify Number of Mines: Next, input the number of mines you want to be hidden on the board. Keep in mind that more mines mean a greater challenge!

Gameplay

Once you've configured the game, the Minesweeper board will appear, consisting of rows and columns of cells. Here's how you can navigate and play the game:

View the Game Board: The game board will be displayed in the terminal with cells represented by "#." Mines are marked as "X." Each cell is identified by a letter for the row and a number for the column.

Make a Move: To make your first move, input a cell to reveal. You'll specify the cell's location by entering the row's letter and the column number. For example, if you want to reveal the top-left cell, input "A1."

Explore the Board: As you make your moves, the revealed cells will display numbers. These numbers indicate how many mines are adjacent to that cell. Use this information to strategically uncover safe cells while avoiding mines.

Flag Mines: If you suspect a cell contains a mine, you can flag it by entering the cell's location (e.g., "B3"). Use flags to keep track of potential mines.

Winning the Game: Your objective is to uncover all the safe cells without revealing any mines. If you successfully uncover all safe cells, you win the game!

Losing the Game: Be cautious! If you uncover a cell with a mine, the game is lost, and the terminal will display your defeat.

Try Again: If you'd like to play another round, simply restart the game and follow the setup instructions.

Minesweeper is all about strategy and deduction. Use the information provided by revealed cells to uncover the entire board without triggering any mines. Good luck and enjoy your Minesweeper adventure in the Python terminal!
